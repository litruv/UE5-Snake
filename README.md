# Snake Game in Unreal Engine 5.5

This is a classic Snake game built entirely with Unreal Engine widgets and displayed directly in the game world. Move the snake using WASD keys to collect food, grow longer, and avoid crashing into yourself. The game leverages Unreal's UMG (UI system) for rendering the game as widgets while placing them in a 3D environment.
